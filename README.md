# Code Review for GitHub

## Overview:
This program serves as a binary converter, allowing users to convert between decimal numbers and binary representations. The code is well-organized, and it employs functions for each conversion task. However, there are areas where improvements can be made. Below is a detailed review along with suggested modifications.

### Code Structure and Organization:
The overall structure is clear, with distinct functions for converting numbers to binary (`number_to_binary`) and binary to numbers (`binary_to_number`). However, the main function could benefit from further modularization. Consider breaking down the main logic into smaller functions for better maintainability.

#### Example:
```c
void displayMenu();
int getUserOption();
```

### User Input Handling:
The program prompts the user for input, but there's a lack of input validation. It's important to ensure that the entered option is valid (1 or 2) and handle incorrect input gracefully.

#### Example:
```c
int getUserOption() {
    int option;
    while (1) {
        printf("Enter an option (1 or 2): ");
        if (scanf("%d", &option) == 1 && (option == 1 || option == 2)) {
            break;
        } else {
            printf("Invalid input. Please enter 1 or 2.\n");
            // Clear input buffer in case of non-integer input
            while (getchar() != '\n');
        }
    }
    return option;
}
```

### Console Clearing:
The code uses an escape sequence (`\033[H\033[J`) to clear the console. While this works on many systems, it might not be universally supported. Consider using system-specific methods or libraries for better compatibility.

### Function Documentation:
Add comments or documentation to explain the purpose and usage of each function. This enhances code readability and helps others understand your code.

#### Example:
```c
/**
 * @brief Converts a decimal number to its binary representation.
 */
void number_to_binary() {
    // ...
}
```

### Magic Numbers:
The code contains magic numbers (e.g., 10 in `b_n % 10`). Consider using named constants or enumerations to make the code more readable and maintainable.

#### Example:
```c
#define BINARY_DIGIT 10

// ...

int bit = b_n % BINARY_DIGIT;
```

## Conclusion:
Your code is functional and accomplishes the intended task. By incorporating the suggested improvements, you can enhance its readability, maintainability, and user interaction. Feel free to customize the modifications based on your preferences and coding standards.
