Certainly, I'll provide a detailed explanation of how your program works.

### Overall Program Structure:

The program serves as a binary converter, allowing users to convert decimal numbers to binary representations and vice versa. The overall structure is as follows:

1. The program starts by declaring and initializing global variables `n_b` and `b_n`, which store the decimal number to be converted to binary and the binary number to be converted to decimal, respectively.

2. The `main` function displays a menu to the user, allowing them to choose between converting a decimal number to binary (`Number to binary`) or a binary number to decimal (`Binary to number`).

3. Depending on the user's choice, the program calls the appropriate function (`number_to_binary` or `binary_to_number`) to perform the conversion.

### Conversion of Decimal to Binary (`number_to_binary`):

1. The user enters a decimal number (`n_b`) to be converted to binary.

2. The function uses a `for` loop to iterate over each binary place value in the binary representation of the number.

    a. At each iteration, it calculates the largest power of 2 (`binary_basic_two`) that is less than or equal to the remaining number (`n_b`).
    
    b. If this power of 2 can be subtracted from `n_b` without becoming negative, it means that this bit is present in the binary representation. In this case, the bit 1 is printed; otherwise, the bit 0 is printed.

3. The result is a binary representation of the entered decimal number.

### Conversion of Binary to Decimal (`binary_to_number`):

1. The user enters a binary number (`b_n`) to be converted to decimal.

2. The function uses a `while` loop to iterate over each digit of the binary number.

    a. At each iteration, it retrieves the rightmost bit (`bit`) by taking the modulo 10.
    
    b. The bit is added to the sum (`number`) after being multiplied by the appropriate power of 2.

    c. The binary number is then divided by 10 to move to the next bit, and the bit weight is incremented.

3. The result is a successful conversion from binary to decimal.

### Points of Attention:

1. **Console Clearing:** The `\033[H\033[J` line is used to clear the console. It may not work on all systems. Alternative system-specific approaches may be considered.

2. **Input Validation:** User input validation could be improved to handle scenarios where the user enters non-numeric characters or invalid options.

3. **Magic Numbers:** The use of "magic" numbers (like 10 in `b_n % 10`) could be replaced with constants for better readability.

In general, your program works correctly, and these detailed explanations should help in understanding its functionality.
