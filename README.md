Certainly, I'll provide a detailed explanation of how your program works.

### Overall Program Structure:

The program serves as a binary converter, allowing users to convert decimal numbers to binary representations and vice versa. The overall structure is as follows:

1. The program starts by declaring and initializing global variables `n_b` and `b_n`, which store the decimal number to be converted to binary and the binary number to be converted to decimal, respectively.

2. The `main` function displays a menu to the user, allowing them to choose between converting a decimal number to binary (`Number to binary`) or a binary number to decimal (`Binary to number`).

3. Depending on the user's choice, the program calls the appropriate function (`number_to_binary` or `binary_to_number`) to perform the conversion.

### Conversion of Decimal to Binary (`number_to_binary`):

1. The user enters a decimal number (`n_b`) to be converted to binary.

2. The function uses a `for` loop to iterate over each binary place value in the binary representation of the number.

    a. At each iteration, it calculates the largest power of 2 (`binary_basic_two`) that is less than or equal to the remaining number (`n_b`).
    
    b. If this power of 2 can be subtracted from `n_b` without becoming negative, it means that this bit is present in the binary representation. In this case, the bit 1 is printed; otherwise, the bit 0 is printed.

3. The result is a binary representation of the entered decimal number.

### Conversion of Binary to Decimal (`binary_to_number`):

1. The user enters a binary number (`b_n`) to be converted to decimal.

2. The function uses a `while` loop to iterate over each digit of the binary number.

    a. At each iteration, it retrieves the rightmost bit (`bit`) by taking the modulo 10.
    
    b. The bit is added to the sum (`number`) after being multiplied by the appropriate power of 2.

    c. The binary number is then divided by 10 to move to the next bit, and the bit weight is incremented.

3. The result is a successful conversion from binary to decimal.

### Points of Attention:

1. **Console Clearing:** The `\033[H\033[J` line is used to clear the console. It may not work on all systems. Alternative system-specific approaches may be considered.

2. **Input Validation:** User input validation could be improved to handle scenarios where the user enters non-numeric characters or invalid options.

3. **Magic Numbers:** The use of "magic" numbers (like 10 in `b_n % 10`) could be replaced with constants for better readability.

In general, your program works correctly, and these detailed explanations should help in understanding its functionality.

Certainly! Here's an explanation you can add to your GitHub for the decimalToHexadecimal function:

c
Copy code
/**
 * Converts a decimal number to its hexadecimal representation.
 *
 * @param decimalNumber The decimal number to be converted.
 */
void decimalToHexadecimal(int decimalNumber) {
    int quotient;
    int remainder;
    int i = 1;
    char hexadecimalNumber[100];

    // Initialize quotient with the decimal number
    quotient = decimalNumber;

    // Perform the conversion using division and remainders
    while (quotient != 0) {
        remainder = quotient % 16;

        // Convert the remainder to a hexadecimal character
        if (remainder < 10)
            hexadecimalNumber[i++] = remainder + '0';
        else
            hexadecimalNumber[i++] = remainder + 'A' - 10;

        quotient = quotient / 16;
    }

    // Display the hexadecimal representation in reverse order
    printf("The hexadecimal representation is: ");
    for (int j = i - 1; j > 0; j--)
        printf("%c", hexadecimalNumber[j]);

    printf("\n");
}
Explanation:

Parameters: The function takes a single parameter decimalNumber, representing the decimal number to be converted to hexadecimal.
Initialization: Variables quotient and remainder are used to perform the division, and i is an index variable for storing hexadecimal digits in the hexadecimalNumber array.
Conversion Loop: The while loop iterates as long as the quotient is not zero. At each iteration, it calculates the remainder when dividing by 16, which represents a hexadecimal digit.
Hexadecimal Character Conversion: The if-else statement converts the remainder to a hexadecimal character. If the remainder is less than 10, it corresponds to the digits 0-9; otherwise, it corresponds to the letters A-F. The character is then stored in the hexadecimalNumber array.
Displaying the Result: After the loop, the function displays the hexadecimal representation by iterating through the hexadecimalNumber array in reverse order.
Note: This implementation assumes a non-negative decimal number input.
